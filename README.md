[Code Platoon](https://www.codeplatoon.org/) is a nonprofit Coding Bootcamp that strictly serves the military community. Our award winning program is designed to train deeply interested beginners and prepare them for careers in software development.

We are looking for a major in Computer Science, rising sophomore or higher to be a teaching assistant (TA) for our Full-stack Software Engineering Bootcamp. We do not expect the TA to know the material beforehand, but do expect that they will spend enough time preparing ahead of time so that when the material is presented to the class, the TA will be able to be an ‘advanced beginner’. Aside from learning the material, the TA’s primary responsibility will be to assist students with their coding assignments during the rest of the day.

 - [Here is a snapshot of what you will learn.](https://www.codeplatoon.org/full-stack/course-curriculum/)

This is an excellent opportunity for an aspiring software developer to learn real-world coding skills, as our program prepares students to go directly into the job market as software developers.

The TA will essentially get a $17,000 education (cost of the program) for free. A side benefit for the TA will be access to our extensive software developer community.
